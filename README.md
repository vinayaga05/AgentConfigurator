# CopilotKit <> LangGraph Starter

This is a starter template for building AI agents using [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) and [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai). It provides a modern Next.js application with an integrated LangGraph agent to be built on top of.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Python 3.8+
- Poetry 2+
- Any of the following package managers:
  - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (recommended)
  - npm
  - [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
  - [bun](https://bun.sh/)
- Google Gemini API Key (for the LangGraph agent)

> **Note:** This repository ignores lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, bun.lockb) to avoid conflicts between different package managers. Each developer should generate their own lock file using their preferred package manager. After that, make sure to delete it from the .gitignore.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager:
```bash
# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install

# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using bun
bun install
```

2. Install Python dependencies for the LangGraph agent:
```bash
# Using pnpm
pnpm install:agent

# Using npm
npm run install:agent

# Using yarn
yarn install:agent

# Using bun
bun run install:agent
```

3. Set up your Google Gemini API key:
```bash
echo 'GOOGLE_API_KEY=GOOGLE_API_KEY' > agent/.env
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
# Using pnpm
pnpm dev

# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev

# Using bun
bun run dev
```

This will start both the UI and agent servers concurrently.

## Available Scripts
The following scripts can also be run using your preferred package manager:
- `dev` - Starts both UI and agent servers in development mode
- `dev:debug` - Starts development servers with debug logging enabled
- `dev:ui` - Starts only the Next.js UI server
- `dev:agent` - Starts only the LangGraph agent server
- `build` - Builds the Next.js application for production
- `start` - Starts the production server
- `lint` - Runs ESLint for code linting
- `install:agent` - Installs Python dependencies for the agent

## Documentation

The main UI component is in `src/app/page.tsx`. You can:
- Modify the theme colors and styling
- Add new frontend actions
- Customize the CopilotKit sidebar appearance

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Connection Issues
If you see "I'm having trouble connecting to my tools", make sure:
1. The LangGraph agent is running on port 8123
2. Your Google Gemini API key is set correctly
3. Both servers started successfully

### Python Dependencies
If you encounter Python import errors:
```bash
cd agent
poetry lock && poetry install
```
